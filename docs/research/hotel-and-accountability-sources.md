# Hotel and accountability sources

This is the most important product expansion beyond a standard asylum statistics site.

The evidence split is:

- official national statistics on people in hotels and overall accommodation
- official committee, audit, and media sources on cost and contractor performance
- local authority statements, FOIs, planning cases, and parliamentary references that identify named hotel sites or unnamed hotel counts in specific places

## Product implication

The hotel tracker should not pretend to have one perfect official list. It should instead expose three parallel views:

- `official national hotel use`
- `publicly identified named sites`
- `place-level sightings where hotel use is confirmed but names are withheld`

That makes the secrecy gap visible instead of letting it disappear into methodology notes.

## Production rules

- Every named-site row must carry a confidence label.
- Use `named_current`, `named_historical`, `unnamed_count_only`, and `parliamentary_reference` as evidence classes.
- Prefer council statements, planning papers, FOI responses, parliamentary material, and public inquiry documents over newspaper-only sourcing.
- If only media coverage exists, mark the row as provisional until stronger evidence is found.
