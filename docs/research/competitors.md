# Competitors and adjacent products

This is not a normal winner-takes-all market. The site will compete with government pages, regional dashboards, think-tank explainers, and generic migration data tools.

## Reviewed products

| Product | What it does well | Where it falls short | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UKFlow | Clean migration topic navigation and broad dataset coverage | Not asylum/refugee-specific, limited product depth on local comparison, easy to feel generic | https://ukflow.uk/ |
| The Migration Observatory local data guides | Strong explanation and context, trusted by journalists and policy users | More explainer than live product, not built around fast place comparison, limited dashboard feel | https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/reports/local-data-guide-to-immigration/ |
| Migration Yorkshire dashboards | Good regional execution and practical policy framing | Regional scope only, fragmented across pages, not a UK-wide comparison tool | https://www.migrationyorkshire.org.uk/ |
| North East Migration Partnership | Regional dashboard pattern and service information | Scope is regional, product language is service-led rather than analysis-led | https://www.nemp.org.uk/ |
| East Midlands migration heatmaps | Immediate geographic picture | Static feel, limited narrative, weak comparison workflow | https://www.eastmidlandscouncils.gov.uk/what-we-do/migration/ |
| GOV.UK statistical releases | Authoritative and current | Hard to compare places, weak storytelling, fragmented tables, inconsistent user journey | https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/immigration-system-statistics |

## Main gap in the market

No obvious public product currently combines all of the following in one place:

- UK-wide asylum and refugee focus rather than generic migration coverage
- cross-area comparison at local authority, region, nation, and peer-group level
- time series that clearly separate official counts, derived estimates, and archived recoveries
- source-level provenance on every visual
- analysis that explains trend shifts instead of leaving users with raw charts

That is the opening for asylumstats.co.uk.

## What asylumstats should do better

### 1. Make comparison the core interaction

Most competitors make you browse one place or one publication at a time. asylumstats should let users pick:

- area A vs area B
- area vs region
- area vs UK
- area vs peer group

The comparison should update every chart on the page.

### 2. Treat methodology as a product feature

Competitors often hide caveats in PDF notes. Your site should surface:

- exact source family
- release date
- whether a number is official, estimated, or archive-derived
- geographic limitations

This will make journalists and researchers trust it faster.

### 3. Combine dashboards with editorial insight

Pure dashboards are forgettable. The site should generate short analysis blocks such as:

- biggest annual increase
- fastest deceleration
- unusual divergence from regional trend
- change in share of UK total

That makes the site useful even to people who do not want to build their own chart.

### 4. Handle spending honestly

Nobody credible can claim to show perfect regional asylum spending from one dataset. The better approach is:

- separate actual spend, tariff-based estimates, and national-only spend
- label each one clearly
- explain what can and cannot be compared

That is better than pretending the data is cleaner than it is.

### 5. Win on information architecture

Competitor products are often fragmented. asylumstats should have a simple structure:

- home
- compare
- places
- spending
- sources
- methodology

Users should never have to guess whether a chart sits under policy content, downloads, or an archive page.

## Product principles

- Do one domain exceptionally well: asylum and refugee trends in the UK.
- Prefer fewer but sharper charts over a cluttered dashboard wall.
- Make every metric available both as counts and rates when denominators exist.
- Show change over time first, rankings second.
- Default to explanation, not neutral chart dumping.

## Concrete differentiation ideas

- “Why this area matters” panels on area pages.
- Automatic peer groups such as core cities, London boroughs, rural districts, or high-dispersal areas.
- Archive labelling that shows when a regional series was recovered from a historical page.
- Download buttons for chart-ready CSV slices, not just giant source tables.
- A release diary page showing which series updated most recently.
