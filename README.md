# asylumstats.co.uk project pack

This folder is a build-ready planning pack and starter repo for a UK asylum and refugee accountability site.

It is designed around a static GitHub-hosted website with a repeatable data build, strong source provenance, and room for both official statistics and recovered regional archive series, local authority hotel evidence, and cost/accountability reporting.

## What is in here

## Recommended build direction

- Site framework: `Astro` or `Next.js` with static export.
- Data build: `Python + DuckDB + Parquet`.
- Charts: `Observable Plot` for line/bar/rank charts and `MapLibre` or static SVG for geography.
- Hosting: `GitHub Pages` or a static host with GitHub Actions.
- Update model: scheduled Action plus manual dispatch for release days.

## Product position

The site should not be another generic migration dashboard. It should be the best public place to:

- compare any UK area against peers and the national picture
- track asylum and refugee trends over time
- expose the hidden and shifting hotel estate
- track where costs, secrecy, and pressure are concentrated
- separate official counts from estimates and archive recoveries
- explain what changed, not just show charts
- make methodology and source provenance obvious on every chart

## Public data scope

The public product should only publish:

- `route_specific` sources such as small boat arrivals, asylum support totals, hotel counts, refugee resettlement schemes, Refugee Family Reunion, and clearly labelled Ukraine humanitarian-route data
- `local_route_relevant` evidence such as council statements, FOIs, and planning records explicitly referring to asylum hotels, refugee housing, Afghan arrivals, or Ukraine arrivals

It should not publish generic council spending, budgets, or procurement as if those were route-specific asylum or refugee spending.

Those wider council models can remain in the repo, but only as `context_only` infrastructure until specific rows are tied back to a route or scheme.

## Platform direction

The asylum site should sit on top of a broader accountability data platform, not a one-off dataset folder.

The current Lancashire / AI DOGE implementation already proves the broader platform can cover:

- spending transactions and fast search indexes
- budgets and GOV.UK finance outturns
- procurement notices
- meetings and voting records
- councillor and integrity datasets
- elections, wards, and geography
- cross-council supplier profiles

The new Lancashire modelling files in this repo are there to turn that practical experience into a cleaner canonical system.

## Live Lancashire layer

The repo now includes a real first-pass canonical ingestion for `Lancashire County Council`.

Run the current repo with:

- `npm run fetch:lancashirecc`
- `npm run transform:lancashirecc`
- `npm run ingest:lancashirecc`
- `npm run fetch:routes`
- `npm run transform:routes`
- `npm run ingest:routes`
- `npm run transform:hotels`
- `npm run ingest:hotels`
- `npm run transform:money`
- `npm run ingest:money`

Current outputs:

- raw files in `data/raw/lancashire_cc/`
- raw manifest in `data/raw/manifests/lancashire_cc.json`
- canonical outputs in `data/canonical/lancashire_cc/`
- marts in `data/marts/lancashire_cc/`
- live council pages at `/councils` and `/councils/lancashire-cc`

The current marts are designed to expose weak spots, not hide them. As of the latest run they show:

- `753,220` transaction rows across `20` monthly files
- a missing upstream monthly file for `2024-08`
- `GBP 255.0 million` tied to supplier labels containing `REDACT*`
- budget mapping coverage of `59.5%`
- a `GBP 127.8 million` difference between the upstream mapping layer total and the canonical transaction corpus

That Lancashire layer is useful as background accountability infrastructure, but it is not part of the public route-specific spend layer.

## Live route, hotel, and money layers

The public product is no longer mock-only.

Current live marts now include:

- `data/marts/uk_routes/` and `src/data/live/route-dashboard.json`
- `data/marts/hotel_entities/` and `src/data/live/hotel-entity-ledger.json`
- `data/marts/money_ledger/` and `src/data/live/money-ledger.json`

As of the latest run:

- the route layer contains `13,482` canonical observations across `361` areas
- the hotel entity layer contains `9` named sites, `4` current named sites, `4` entity links, `4` integrity signals, and `3` unnamed-only areas
- the public money layer contains `11` rows, `6` rows with explicit published GBP values, and `9` supplier or public-body profiles

The money layer is intentionally broad at this stage. It combines:

- current prime-provider regional scope
- official funding instructions and tariff components
- scrutiny and cost rows such as the `GBP 15.3 billion` 10-year forecast and `GBP 5.77 million` daily hotel cost

This is deliberate. It gives the public a visible accountability chain now, while local procurement and subcontractor ingestion is still missing.

## Editorial angle

The strongest version of asylumstats is not anti-migrant and not neutral-bureaucratic either. It should be an accountability product aimed at:

- Home Office secrecy
- expensive hotel dependence
- uneven geographic concentration
- slow decision-making that keeps people in temporary accommodation longer
- opaque contractor performance and public spending

That is where the “scandalous” energy should go: toward waste, opacity, and system failure, not toward asylum seekers themselves.

## Strongest hooks confirmed from current public sources

- On `2026-02-26`, the Home Office said `107,200` people were receiving asylum support at the end of `December 2025`, with `31,000` in hotel accommodation and around `64,000` awaiting an initial decision.
- On `2026-01-23`, the government told the Home Affairs Committee there were `197` asylum hotels in use as of `2026-01-05`, down from more than `400` in summer `2023`.
- On `2024-11-08`, the National Audit Office said hotels housed `35%` of people in asylum accommodation but accounted for `76%` of annual accommodation contract costs in the first seven months of `2024/25`, with the 10-year accommodation contract forecast rising to `GBP 15.3 billion`.
- On `2025-06-12`, the Home Office said hotel use cost `GBP 5.77 million` per day on average in `2024/25`.
- On `2025-11-27`, the latest local-authority asylum and resettlement release publicly available on GOV.UK still showed the year ending `September 2025`, with Glasgow, Birmingham, Liverpool, Hillingdon, and Manchester holding the highest support counts.

## Important data caveat

As of `2026-02-28`, the latest national asylum statistics chapters were published for the year ending `December 2025` on `2026-02-26`, while the latest public local-authority and regional tables surfaced in the researched GOV.UK pages were still the year ending `September 2025`, updated `2025-11-27`. Build the site so release calendars can differ by dataset family.

## Current handoff state

The repo is now ready to hand to Claude as an extension job rather than a blank build:

- Astro site scaffold is live and builds cleanly
- routes page uses official transformed data
- hotels page uses the live hotel entity ledger rather than mock site rows
- spending page uses the live public money ledger rather than concept-only copy
- methodology and sources pages explain scope and provenance rules

The main missing layers for the next builder are:

- deeper normalization of refugee funding instruction tariff tables
- local response contracts and council procurement tied to named hotels or schemes
- subcontractor ingestion and supplier network expansion
- generated place pages from live route, hotel, and money marts instead of the remaining mocked place set
